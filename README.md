# Code Repositories
1. [Faceswap](https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap) is a tool that utilizes deep learning to recognize and swap faces in pictures and videos based on original u/deepfakes code.

2. [Faceswap2](https://github.com/joshua-wu/deepfakes_faceswap) another repo based on original u/deepfakes code.

3.  [Faceit](https://github.com/goberoi/faceit) a wrapper around Faceswap.

4. [DeepFaceLab](https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab) Another version of faceswap

5. [DeepfakeCapsuleGAN](https://github.com/snknitin/DeepfakeCapsuleGAN) Using Capsule GANs for deepfake generation

6. [Large resolution facemasked](https://github.com/dfaker/df) , weirdly warped, deepfake.

7. [Disrupting Deepfakes](https://github.com/natanielruiz/disrupting-deepfakes): Defending against image translation deepfakes using adversarial attacks.
